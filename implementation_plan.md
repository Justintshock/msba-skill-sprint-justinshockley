# Implementation Plan

## What does this repository do?
Demonstrates basic SQL query structure. It shows how SQL can be used to retrieve and filter customer data.

## What would need to change for a real company?
In a real company setting, these queries would need to connect to a live database, use real table schemas, and be validated against business rules. More testing would also be required.

## Proof of Attempt
I created a sample SQL query file to show understanding of SQL syntax and GitHub. This reflects an initial step in strengthening SQL skills.
